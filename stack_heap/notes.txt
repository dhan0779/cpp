both the stack and the heap are located in RAM, but heap can grow/shrink

how do we find contiguous four block of memory? memory allocation
freelist  keeps track of which block of memory is available -> from malloc
actual implementation of malloc is dependent, if it needs to ask for more memory than what's 
available in the free list, that can be even more expensive

CPU cache misses
the performance difference, is the allocation -> so preallocating 4GB is basically the exact same
